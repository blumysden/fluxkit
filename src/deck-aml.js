**could do**

notes:
**SCOTT**<br/>

One project I lead at the Times is called "Adventure", and it's a tool for creating interactive articles.

Many of those interactive articles are really just quizzes.  Some are quiz-like.  Some are more like Choose Your Own Adventures, and some are other things.

My absolute favorite question from the people who use the tool, our Adventure-creators, is "I'm working on a piece about *x* and was wondering: could you do something like *y*?"

And one of my main goals in building the tool is to be able to say "Why, yes!" as often as possible.

Now, just because you **could** do something, does that mean it's a good idea?

**SCOTT**

Well, no, obviously not.

But in my experience, it's not always as bad an idea as it might seem at first.  And I think if you're willing to entertain the bad idea for a while...let it sit down on the sofa, offer it a beer or something stronger, really get to know it better... sometimes it blossoms into a much better idea.
