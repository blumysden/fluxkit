~~should do~~<br/>

**could do**
:end

notes:
**SCOTT**<br/>

Let me tell you where I'm coming from: one project I lead at the Times is called "Adventure", and it's a tool for creating interactive articles.

Many of those interactive articles are really just quizzes.

Some of the pieces are article-like and quiz-like at the same time.  Some are more like Choose Your Own Adventures, and some are other things.

My absolute favorite question, however, from the people who use the tool, our Adventure-creators, is "I'm working on a piece about *x* and was wondering: could you do something like *y*?"

And one of my main goals in building the tool is to be able to say "Why, yes, we could!" as often as possible.

Now, just because you **could** do something, does that mean it's a good idea?

:end

We're going to talk about and around the idea of "interactive journalism".  In doing so, we're not concerned with what you should or should not do as creators of interactive journalism.  I don't honestly know, and I personally don't pay much attention when someone else tries to tell me.

We're interested in getting you in the habit of thinking deeply about what you **could** do.

**SCOTT**

Well, no, obviously not.

And we do have debates about whether The New York Times *should* be making quizzes, and these other things.  And how these pieces *should* be designed and written.  And of course those discussions are important, but I think in practice *should* discussions often come WAY too early.  I think most should be preceeded by a long, earnest *could* investigation.

Because in my experience, good ideas rarely arrive in a flash, and many apparently bad ideas are not as bad as they might seem at first.  I believe if you're willing to entertain the bad idea for a while...let it sit down on the sofa, offer it a beer or something stronger, really get to know it better... sometimes it blossoms into a much better idea.

And the other reason to focus on could is that it's much more fun.  Could is the seed of play.

Could is meaningless without any limitations.  To get to any meaningful idea of what we could do, we need to agree on some set of things that we definitely ARE doing.  Right?

So we are going to spend some time exploring and trying to agree on a set of parameters for interactive journalism that interest us.

And that *US* leads me to the last point.

notes:

Take the time to think this through.  Start with this "anyone".  How different might their home be from yours?  What are the key sensations you absolutely must replciate in order for this to be successful?  What physical, mental, spritual conditions must be conjured?

Approach the task with a spirit of generosity.
