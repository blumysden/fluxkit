hed: What is this all about?

content:

I think we interactive-makers are selling ourselves short and we are selling our readers short.

:end

notes:

Now I work with very smart, and very talented people who I admire enormously, and I think we produce some pretty excellent, innovative work on a regular basis.

But I still think we habitually limit our creativity.  At The New York Times, at least, I trace this to a few diffferent causes:

* Collectively we have very high journalistic and aesthetic standards.
* Individually, many of us scorn published work that we think doesn't meet that standard (or doesn't interest us personally)
* We rarely have the time and people to explore and develop our hunches
* We often operate under the assumption that our readers are impatient and mostly unwilling to learn and try new things

Under these circumstances, when we set out to write a new story, it is safer to peruse the menu of past successes, and shoehorn the content into the most attention-grabbing one, assuming we can get together the right people to make it happen.

I believe there's a cost to this\:

* We end up spending a lot of time polishing a few good ideas to a very high sheen at the expense of nourishing new ones.
* Low morale.  I know I'm not the only one who feels discouraged that we are constantly told we all must INNOVATE but have such a hard time getting momentum behind our own little ideas.
* Consolidation of power and authority in the hands of those who have the technical ability to deliver on new ideas.  Marginalization of those without, often despite their widsom, experience and institutional knowledge.
* Narrower, less transformative experiences for our readers.

Put in terms the Fluxus artits might have used, I think we have a few enemies to overcome:

hed: Enemies

content:
Expertise

Authority

Expense

Fear
:end

notes:

Now, Fluxus didn't defeat these enemies.  One could argue they failed pretty grandly.

I don't honestly imagine I can overcome them either.  But I believe, collectively, we can begin to gnaw away at these obstacles if we want to, and I think Fluxus' example is a good one to consider.

hed: Fluxus

notes:

So, what is "Fluxus" anyway?

:end

-------------------------------------------
slide: =>

hed: Fluxus

content:

1961-1978 (approximately, arguably)

Influenced by Marcel Duchamp (readymades) and John Cage (indeterminacy, happenings), among others

Artists included Yoko Ono, George Maciunus, Allan Kaprow, Nam Jun Paik, Alison Knowles, George Brecht, Josephy Beuys, Ay-O, and Shigeko Kubota, among others.

:end

notes:

Fluxus is an internationally distributed and interdisciplinary artist collective that produced and presented works together in the 1960s and 1970s.
They were radical and experimental in their practice, pushing against the Art World establishment of the time.

Working in both object-based and time-based modes, they made paintings, sculptures, and books. They composed and wrote.
They gave performances and organized participatory events called happenings. The created immersive environments.

Fluxus was influenced by Marcel Duchamp's readymades, which are ordinary manufactured objects repositioned by the artist as found art,
as well as John Cage's compositions in which some aspects of a musical work are left open to chance or to the interpreter's free choice.

One of them, a Lithuanian artist named George Maciunus, considered this stream of work and energy to be a movement and he called it Fluxus.

Pronounced George Ma-**choo**-nus

My proposal for this session is that we really investigate this idea together, and see if we can come up some principles and strategies that will make our work richer and more rewarding, for us and our readers.

So let's start with an exercise.

Approach the task with a spirit of generosity.

ugc: 1

notes:

I think of this exercise as a model for the work of making second person journalism.

We used our own knowledge about something, and our unique personal relationship to it, to design an experience for someone else to inhabit.

I want to talk about this piece and some Fluxus pieces to tease out some of the other qualities that define Second-Person Journalism, in my opinion.

thoughts:

The goal is not to make that person become you, to vanish inside you, but to explore your experience through her or his eyes.

content: CITY PIECE

Walk all over the city with an empty<br/>
baby carriage.

1961 winter

*Yoko Ono, Grapefruit*

:end

notes:

Fluxus didn't create the idea of participatory art.  It really appeared in the early 20th century.  But I like what they did with it.

This is City Piece, by Yoko Ono, from her "book of instructions and drawings," Grapefruit.

Obviously, it's related to the pieces we just created.  Instructions.

If you compare this to that piece, some essential aspects emerge.

~~The aritst (what I'm calling the "composer") vanishes even more completely in this example.  So does the "artwork".~~

:end

-------------------------------------------
slide: =>

hed: Qualities that shape the experience

content:
relative presence or absence of the piece's "composer"

:end

notes:
relative presence, absence of the piece's "composer"
* Yoko Ono vanishes almost completely in City Piece.  What about you?  How present was your voice or your sensibility in your instructions?

locus of audience participation in space and in time
* In these pieces, the audience does not interact with the composition itself, per se, to participate.  It doesn't matter much which form the instructions came in. Originally they were in a book, but there's not much difference whether you read my transcription on the screen or have someone whisper it in your ear (though instructions for someone to do that could, in themselves, be another piece).  You interact with the idea.  And you interact with that idea when and where you choose.

integrity of participation to the realization of the piece
* lastly, though you interact with the idea, I don't think this is purely conceptual art.  You could stop at the idea, but is it really complete if you don't walk around with that baby carriage?

So, is there a correlary we can point to in the realm of SECOND-PERSON journalism?

hed: Eric Asimov's Wine School

img: wine-school.png

notes:

For those who aren't familiar, our wine expert Asmiov discusses a type of wine and why he's interested in it.  Then he recommends three wines to drink over the course of the month, and often he suggests how you should drink them, like this from the "Thirst Quenchers" lesson:

:end

-------------------------------------------
slide: =>

hed: Eric Asimov's Wine School

content:

"Don’t serve these wines with fancy culinary school experiments. Toss some burgers or sausages on the grill, get a rotisserie chicken, make a sandwich, that sort of thing. Lightly chill the wine before pouring, and glou-glou."

:end

notes:

Then you're supposed to send in your thoughts and come back at the end of the month and read the follow-up with his opinions and those of other reader/drinkers.

But it's just an article, right?  Doesn't really matter much if you even read it carefully.  The author (the composer of the experience) matters a bit because he's a wine expert so you're inclined to go along with his plan for you.

**It's the experience of drinking the wine and reflecting on your own experience drinking it, to the extent that you could write something about it, that matters.**

I think it's very, very cool.

content: CUT PIECE

“Cut Piece First version for single performer: Performer sits on stage with a pair of scissors in front of him. It is announced that members of the audience may come on stage—one at a time—to cut a small piece of the performer’s clothing to take with them. Performer remains motionless throughout the piece. Piece ends at the performer’s option.”

*Yoko Ono, 1964*

notes:

Premiered in 1964 and she has performed it multiple times since.

challenge/risk

:end

notes:
presence of the composer is essential
* I suppose it could be someone other than the composer in that role.  the point, though, is that there is another actual person there with whom the audience engages.  What of herself Yoko Ono brings to this piece, as a presence, as a person, is an interesting question.  It seems to me that she both appears and disappears at the same time.

risk
* for the composer AND for the participant. The action is charged in many ways, plays on all kinds of taboos.  And it's done in public, in front of other people. Everyone has to choose just how they will participate or whether they will participate at all.
* for me, this one gets at the heart of the question "What do we dare to ask of the audience?"  And in asking, what does each participant ask herself?
* If you agree with me that this is a risky proposition to make to an audience, ask yourself why she could do it and we are maybe less willing to?

Analogy in the world of SECOND-PERSON journalism?

notes:
Meets all of the criteria, I'd say, even risk since the topic is so personal and scary.  But it makes me ask: do we have any opportunities for live engagement with our people beyond just trading messages?

notes:

This was where I started with this session, and I think it comes closest to exemplifying what most of us really do.

slide: =>

hed: Fingerbox

content:
The hidden contents of the boxes comprise such various things as beads, bristle brushes, hair, cotton balls, nails, and sponges.

The artist's intent, by including things such as nails, which can potentially prick the finger, in the possible contents of the box is to ensure that the user touches the box with an "enquiring, learning gesture". The finger boxes are also intended to be touched by multiple people at a time, promoting a shared, social, experience of perceiving the work.

It is a simple object with a surprising invitation.

It is designed to be interacted with in one way, but there are other possibilities of course, and all of those make up the experience.

content: TO ESTABLISH ARTIST S NONPROFESSIONAL, NONPARASITIC, NONELITE STATUS IN SOCIETY, HE MUST DEMONSTRATE OWN DISPENSIBILITY, HE MUST DEMONSTRATE SELFSUFFICIENCY OF THE AUDIENCE, HE MUST DEMONSTRATE THAT ANYTHING CAN SUBSTITUTE ART AND ANYONE CAN DO IT.  THEREFORE THIS SUBSTITUTE ART-AMUSEMENT MUST BE SIMPLE, AMUSING, CONCERNED WITH INSIGNIFICANCES, HAVE NO COMMODITY OR INSTITUTIONAL VALUE.  IT MUST BE UNLIMITED, OBTAINABLE BY ALL, AND EVENTUALLY PRODUCED BY ALL.  THE ARTIST DOING ART MEANWHILE, TO JUSTIFY HIS INCOME, MUST DEMONSTRATE THAT ONLY HE CAN DO ART.  ART THEREFORE MUST APPEAR TO BE COMPLEX, INTELLECTUAL, EXCLUSIVE, INDISPENSABLE, INSPIRED.

notes:

This is part of one of Maciunus's manifestos for Fluxus. (He created several.)

Maciunus had a particularly grandiose, socialist-tinged, agenda for the work of these artists.
Over time, he either drove out or alienated many of them.  In any case, few who stayed in the fold seemed to have fully embraced his positions and aspirations.

There's one aspect of it though which particularly interests me, and clearly motivated many of the Fluxus artists:

notes:

We've looked at these experiences from both the point of view of composer as well as audience member.

Now is the time for manifestos, where we express what we believe in, why we're doing any of this in the first place.

notes:

In addition to assemblages, environments, concerts, and happenings, Fluxus artists also created
instructions for artworks in Duchamp's ready made tradition.

Performances: present both the thing itself and that thing as something else

Instructions serve eliminate the artist's taste and style in favor of open ended
conception of the work. No two versions of the work are the same, and this
serves only to enrich the end result, like musical scores.
