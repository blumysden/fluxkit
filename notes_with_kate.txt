NOTES WITH KATE

Essential Question:
How can we keep ourselves inspired and creative as we make "SECOND-PERSON JOURNALISM"

We all know that when we set out to make a piece of journalism that we quickly run up again a set of limits:
Well, we have this menu of we can choose from: quiz, charts, multimedia-rich experience, regular old article.
What bucket does it fit into?
And we all limit ourselves, consciously or unconsciously, with a set of assumptions about what our readers WANT and what they are WILLING TO DO.
We also make assumptions about what our colleagues are willing to do.
The fluxus artist rebelled against the conventions of what the role of the artist was and what was acceptable for him or her to do, and also challenged ideas of what an audience should be and would be willing to do.
Yoko Ono cut piece!
Would the audience members get up and cut away her clothing?  Turns out: yes, the did.


What do we want them to know?
I want them to know:

* what the Fluxus movement was and some of the things it did that excite me
  - they are a MOVEMENT
  - they are absurd and playful
  - they are anarchic
  - they were especially interested in the experience of the viewer and they saw the viewer as essential to the artwork, in fact MORE important than the ARTIST

* What is SECOND PERSON JOURNALISM?  My definitions supplemented by yours.  Key principles:
  - it is incomplete without the unique contribution of the reader
  - it is different after the reader engaged with it than it was at the beginning
  - they demand participation from the reader
  - the strive to create a lived experience
  - they inspire some degree of self-reflection
  - they offer choices
  - the choices are contingent not only on the medium but on the circumstances of the reader as he or she interacts
  -

* some strategies for:
  -

Could we do a samson-like challenge, where the number of people who represent themselves as red vs. blue on the page has an effect?
